# Simple-To-Do-website
I have developed a simple To-Do List web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and remove tasks easily. It features a clean and responsive design, making task management simple and efficient. Through this project, I enhanced my front-end development skills, event handling, and styling with CSS.
